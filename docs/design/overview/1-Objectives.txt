BuildingBlocks is a library of reusable code designed to form the foundation of 
more complex web applications.  The intended audience is developers who need a 
quick start getting their projects going and don't want to reinvent the wheel.

The driving principles behind the design are:

  1. component based: you should be able to pick and choose the pieces you like.

  2. designed for integration: you can easily combine this code with an existing
     application.

  3. designed for customization: the database and libraries are documented and 
     designed to be extended and changed to suit your project.
