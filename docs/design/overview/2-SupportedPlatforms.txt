Operating system:
=================

BuildingBlocks are developed under Linux, but the intent is that they should work 
under any operating system that supports the prerequisite databases and libraries.


Databases:
==========

PostgreSQL 9.2+, MySQL 5.6+, MariaDB 5.5+.

Other versions should work as well, but these are what we use for development.


Languages:
==========

PHP 5.4+, Python 2.7+.

Other versions should work, but these are what we use for development.
